Python implementation of elastic-net regularized generalized linear models
==========================================================================

Pyglmnet is a Python library implementing generalized linear models (GLMs)
with advanced regularization options. It provides a wide range of noise models
(with paired canonical link functions) including gaussian, binomial, multinomial,
poisson, and softplus. It supports a wide range of regularizers: ridge, lasso,
elastic net, group lasso, and Tikhonov regularization.

A brief introduction to GLMs
============================

Linear models are estimated as

.. math::
    y = \beta_0 + X\beta + \epsilon

The parameters :math:`\beta_0, \beta` are estimated using ordinary least squares, under the
implicit assumption the :math:`y` is normally distributed.

Generalized linear models allow us to generalize this approach to point-wise
nonlinearities :math:`q(.)` and a family of exponential distributions for :math:`y`.

.. math::
    y = q(\beta_0 + X\beta) + \epsilon

Regularized GLMs are estimated by minimizing a loss function specified by
the penalized negative log-likelihood. The elastic net penalty interpolates
between L2 and L1 norm. Thus, we solve the following optimization problem:

.. math::
    \min_{\beta_0, \beta} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N \mathcal{L} (y_i, \beta_0 + \beta^T x_i)
    + \lambda [ \frac{1}{2}(1 - \alpha) \mathcal{P}_2 + \alpha \mathcal{P}_1 ]

where :math:`\mathcal{P}_2` and :math:`\mathcal{P}_1` are the generalized
L2 (Tikhonov) and generalized L1 (Group Lasso) penalties, given by:

.. math::
    \mathcal{P}_2 & = & \|\Gamma \beta \|_2^2 \\
    \mathcal{P}_1 & = & \sum_g \|\beta_{j,g}\|_2

where :math:`\Gamma` is the Tikhonov matrix: a square factorization of the inverse
covariance matrix and :math:`\beta_{j,g}` is the :math:`j` th coefficient of
group :math:`g`.
