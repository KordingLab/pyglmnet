==================
pyglmnet |release|
==================


``pyglmnet`` is a Python library implementing elastic-net
regularized generalized linear models (GLM). Notations and approach
are followed as in `Friedman, J., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2010) <https://core.ac.uk/download/files/153/6287975.pdf>`_.
The implementation is aim to suite users the same way along side with popular GLM
`R package <https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html>`_.
The only different is that we still use batch gradient descent rather than
coordinate gradient descent which os very fast for ``n_samples x n_features``
size up to 10000 by 1000.
