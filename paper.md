# Summary

[Generalized linear models] are
well-established tools for regression and classification and are widely
applied across the sciences, economics, business, and finance. They are
uniquely identifiable due to their convex loss and easy to interpret due
to their point-wise non-linearities and well-defined noise models.

... add two line equation to explain the model and the solvers.

In the era of exploratory data analyses with a large number of predictor
variables, it is important to regularize. Regularization prevents
overfitting by penalizing the negative log likelihood and can be used to
articulate prior knowledge about the parameters in a structured form.

Despite the attractiveness of regularized GLMs, the available tools in
the Python data science eco-system are highly fragmented. More
specifically,

-  [statsmodels] provides a wide range of link functions but no regularization.
-  [scikit-learn] provides elastic net regularization but only for linear models.
-  [lightning] provides elastic net and group lasso regularization, but only for
   linear and logistic regression.

**Pyglmnet** is a response to this fragmentation. It runs on Python 3.5+,
and here are is a comparison with existing toolboxes.

The implementation is compatible with the existing data science ecosystem.
Pyglmnet API was designed to follow scikit-learn as closely as possible.
Specifically, it is possible to do::


```py
           glm.fit(X, y)
           glm.predict(y)
```

The scikit-learn cross-validation and grid search procedure can be used.

Pyglmnet has already been used in a range of domains.
It is unit tested and has documentation (tutorials, docstrings, examples)
and is unit tested.
