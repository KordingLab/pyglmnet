<p>Tikhonov regularization is a generalized form of L2-regularization. It allows
us to articulate our prior knowlege about correlations between
different predictors with a multivariate Gaussian prior. Here, we demonstrate
how pyglmnet’s Tikhonov regularizer can be used to estimate spatiotemporal
receptive fields (RFs) from neural data.</p>
<p>Neurons in many brain areas, including the frontal eye fields (FEF) have RFs,
defined as regions in the visual field where visual stimuli are most likely
to result in spiking activity.</p>
<p>These spatial RFs need not be static, they can vary in time in a
systematic way. We want to characterize how such spatiotemporal RFs (STRFs)
remap from one fixation to the next. Remapping is a phenomenon where
the RF of a neuron shifts to process visual information from the subsequent
fixation, prior to the onset of the saccade. The dynamics of this shift
from the “current” to the “future” RF is an active area of research.</p>
<p>With Tikhonov regularization, we can specify a prior covariance matrix
to articulate our belief that parameters encoding neighboring points
in space and time are correlated.</p>
